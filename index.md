I am an oceanographer studying the interactions of physics and biogeochemistry in the Southern Ocean. Currently at Caltech, I use data from underwater autonomous vehicles and satellites to understand what role the ocean plays in our climate system. In a past life at MIT, I worked to understand how aerosol droplets produced by sea spray could act as nucleation sites for ice clouds. Overall, I am fascinated by all things Earth science and am thrilled that my job is to ask and answer questions about the amazing planet we live on.
