I am thrilled to announce that I have accepted a <a href="https://cpaess.ucar.edu/cgc/class-33" target="_blank">NOAA Climate & Global Change</a> Postdoctoral Fellowship and will be starting at Brown University working with <a href="https://mara-freilich.github.io/" target="_blank">Mara Freilich</a> on carbon export by small-scale processes in the Southern Ocean!

I am a seagoing oceanographer studying the interactions of physics and biogeochemistry in the Southern Ocean. Currently at Caltech, I work with <a href="http://web.gps.caltech.edu/~andrewt/" target="_blank">Andy Thompson</a> and use data from underwater autonomous vehicles and satellites to understand what role the ocean plays in our climate system. I am broadly interested in how mesoscale and submesoscale dynamics, particularly in the Southern Ocean, affect the efficiency with which carbon dioxide can be transferred from the atmosphere to the deep ocean. Previously, at MIT, I worked to understand how aerosol droplets produced by sea spray could act as nucleation sites for ice clouds. Overall, I am fascinated by all things related to Earth science and am thrilled that my job is to ask and answer questions about the amazing planet we live on.

 Outside of research, I participate in outreach at local middle schools in the Pasadena Unified School District and am passionate about increasing the accessibility of oceanography to historically margnialized students, including Black, Indiginous, Latino/a, first-generation, LGBTQ+, and disabled students. I am also an avid reader and baker and am always looking for my next cookie recipe! I grew up in northeast Florida and am always excited to meet another southerner in oceanography.
