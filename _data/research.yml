- title: "Detection and parameterization of filamentary structures"
  citation: Submesoscale motions occur on the spatial scale of 1 to 10 km, scales that are not resolved in most climate models and that have long been difficult to detect using remote sensing. However, these small but mighty processes may hold the secret to unlocking our understanding of transfer of water between the surface and interior ocean. I use products calculated from data collected from satellites to observe the spatial and temporal variability of submesoscale features across the surface ocean and to describe their connections to carbon export.

- title: "Flow-topography interactions in the Southern Ocean"
  citation: The seabed of the Southern Ocean is covered in underwater mountain ranges. When the main current of the Southern Ocean, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, interacts with this underwater topography, it generates hotspots of mesoscale stirring and submesoscale motions. My work uses in situ observational data and data from satellites to consider how these eddy kinetic energy hotspots impact tracer distributions.
