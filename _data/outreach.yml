- title: "Bringing a Lens of Equity to Geoscience Qualifying Examinations"
  citation: Two colleagues and I published a commentary in <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024AV001260" target="_blank">AGU Advances</a> about inequity in geoscience qualifying examinations and concrete steps graduate programs can take to approach these examinations with an equity mindset. This work was also chose as an <a href=" https://eos.org/editor-highlights/are-the-geosciences-failing-their-qualifying-exam-goals" target="_blank">Editor's Highlight</a> in EOS magazine.

- title: "Science Journey: Exploring Our Blue Planet Using Underwater Robots"
  citation: Every year, Caltech films several rising scientists talking about their journey into science. I was thrilled to be featured in 2023 as I talked to students in grades 5-9 about how my love of ships led to me becoming an oceanographer. You can watch my presentation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Xp25-uqA4" target="_blank">on Youtube</a>.

- title: "Writing about science for a public audience"
  citation: I am always interested in sharing the exciting developments in oceanography and climate science, and I have pursued opportunities to communicate my work through groups that feature science-forward writing. You read some of my writing in The Conversation <a href="https://theconversation.com/in-the-turbulent-drake-passage-scientists-find-a-rare-window-where-carbon-sinks-quickly-into-the-deep-ocean-202428" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://theconversation.com/tagging-seals-with-sensors-helps-scientists-track-ocean-currents-and-a-changing-climate-234242" target="_blank">here</a>.

- title: "Float adoptions with the Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling program"
  citation: The <a href="https://soccom.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">SOCCOM</a> program has extensively expanded our observations across the Southern Ocean with the deployment of hundreds of biogeochemical-Argo floats. Each float is adopted by a classroom and we decorate the float in order to show off their school pride!
