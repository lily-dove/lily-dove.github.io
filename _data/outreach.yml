- title: "Float adoptions with the Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling program"
  citation: The <a href="https://soccom.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">SOCCOM</a> program has extensively expanded our observations across the Southern Ocean with the deployment of hundreds of biogeochemical-Argo floats. Each float is adopted by a classroom and we decorate the float in order to show off their school pride!
