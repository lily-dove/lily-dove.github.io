- title: "Guest Lecturing for ESE 1 (Earth's Climate)"
  citation: I had the honor of teaching the section about oceans for Caltech's introductory climate class for undergraduates, ESE 1. We talked about the ocean's overturning circulation, gyres, oceanic heat transport, and the biological and physical controls carbon uptake and outgassing. Lots to cover in just a few weeks! I was honored to recieve the **Richard H. Jahns Teaching Award** from the Caltech Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences for my contributions to this class.

- title: "Mentor for WAVE Fellows at Caltech"
  citation: The WAVE Fellows program at Caltech seeks to foster diversity in science by increasing the participation of students from marginalized groups. I have had the honor of being a mentor for two phenomenal WAVE fellows, Ellie and Taylor, both of whom were sponsored by the Resnick Sustainability Institute. In summer 2021, Ellie calculated estimates of the eddy subduction and mixed layer carbon pumps using data collected by a glider and a biogeochemical-Argo float as a part of the Southern Area Large Ocean Carbon Experiment (SOLACE). During summer 2022, Taylor worked with glider and satellite data to describe the structure of the fronts in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current at Drake Passage. I am so grateful to have been a part of their scientific journies!

- title: "Teaching Assistant for ESE 102 (Earth's Oceans)"
  citation: I came to graduate school expecting to study atmospheric chemistry but this class played a huge role in sparking my interest in oceanography! I have had a wonderful time TAing the class for two years in two very different classroom experiences - one in-person and one virtual. My experience with being on the teaching staff for this class has contributed to my **Certificate of Practice in Effective Teaching** at Caltech.
