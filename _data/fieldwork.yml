- title: "GO-SHIP P02 Leg 2"
  citation: I sailed aboard the RV <i>Roger Revelle</i> in June-July 2022 as part of the Global Oceans Ship-based Hydrography Investigations Program (GO-SHIP) transect of the North Pacific. Starting in Hawai`i and sailing to San Diego over five extremely wave-free weeks, we performed over 100 CTD stations, often down to 6000 meters depth. I helped operate and process data from the Lowered Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (LADCP), which gives us data about the direction and magnitude of ocean currents.

- title: "Bellingshausen and Amundsen Seas"
  citation: In January-March 2020, I was on board the RVIB <i>Nathaniel B. Palmer</i> helping to deploy gliders as a part of the Transport of the Antarctic Peninsula and Bellingshausen Sea: Antarctic Slope Current Origins (TABASCO) project. While on board, I also helped deploy biogeochemical-Argo floats and learned a lot about marine geochemistry from the rest of the science party, who were primarily part of the Thwaites Offshore Research (THOR) program.

#- title: "Teaching Assistant for ESE 102 (Earth's Oceans)"
#  citation: I came to graduate school expecting to study atmospheric chemistry but this class played a huge role in sparking my interest in oceanography! I have had a wonderful time TAing the class for two years in two very different classroom experiences - one in-person and one virtual. My experience with being on the teaching staff for this class has contributed to my **Certificate of Practice in Effective Teaching** at Caltech.
