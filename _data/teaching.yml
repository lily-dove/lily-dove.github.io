- title: "Guest Lecturing for ESE 1 (Earth`s Climate)"
  citation: I had the honor of teaching the section about oceans for Caltech`s introductory climate class for undergraduates, ESE 1. We talked about the ocean`s overturning circulation, gyres, oceanic heat transport, and the biological and physical controls carbon uptake and outgassing. Lots to cover in just a few weeks! I was honored to recieve the **Richard H. Jahns Teaching Award** from the Caltech Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences for my contributions to this class.

- title: "*The Great British Baking Show* as an Educational Framework"
  citation: My officemate at Caltech <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v5kgA60AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao" target="_blank">Harrison Parker</a> is both an awesome atmospheric chemist and also a fellow baker. We were talking one day about how structure of *The Great British Baking Show* offers a great metaphor for higher education and is a perfect starting place for examining the frameworks we set in place for our students. We created a presentation that we have now given several times in academic settings that describes, with this metaphor, how by creating a more welcoming, inclusive, and transparent environment in the classroom, we can raise student motivation, increase academic rigor, and improve the educational experience for all parties.
