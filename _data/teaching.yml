- title: "Guest Lecturing for ESE 1 (Earth's Climate)"
  citation: "I had the honor of teaching the section about oceans for Caltech's introductory climate class for undergraduates, ESE 1. We talked about the ocean's overturning circulation, gyres, oceanic heat transport, and the biological and physical controls carbon uptake and outgassing. Lots to cover in just a few weeks! I was honored to recieve the **Richard H. Jahns Teaching Award** from the Caltech Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences for my contributions to this class."

  citation: "I came to graduate school expecting to study atmospheric chemistry but this class played a huge role in helping me get interested in oceanography! I've really loved TAing ESE 102 two times after taking it, in two very different formats: once in person and once virtually. "
