- title: "Guest Lecturing for ESE 1 (Earth's Climate)"
  citation: "I had the honor of teaching the section about oceans for Caltech's introductory climate class for undergraduates, ESE 1. We talked about the ocean's overturning circulation, gyres, oceanic heat transport, and the biological and physical controls carbon uptake and outgassing. Lots to cover in just a few weeks! I was honored to recieve the Richard H. Jahn's Teaching Award from the Caltech Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences for my contributions to this class."

- title: "Float adoptions with the Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling program"
  citation: The <a href="https://soccom.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">SOCCOM</a> program has extensively expanded our observations across the Southern Ocean with the deployment of hundreds of biogeochemical-Argo floats. Each float is adopted by a classroom and we decorate the float in order to show off their school pride!
